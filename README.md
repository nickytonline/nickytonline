My name is Nick Taylor. I am a Lead Software Engineer with a focus on the front-end at Forem, the software that powers <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a>. I am a <em>big</em> fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, (P)React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy contributing to open source, hitting the gym, snowboarding, and a long long time ago, rugby.
