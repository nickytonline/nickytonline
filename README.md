# <em>Hi!</em> I'm Nick. üëãüèª

I'm from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) on the ecosystem team, focusing on front-end technologies and tooling. I also have a growing interest in serverless and edge computing. I also [stream on Twitch](https://iamdeveloper.live/).

I'm not a big fan of spiders, but I know they're doing good work eating bugs. Aside from programming, I enjoy contributing to open source, hitting the gym, snowboarding, and rugby a long time ago. More about me at [iamdeveloper.com](https://iamdeveloper.com).

## DEV Twitch Stream

The DEV Twitch stream is something I started with my old co-worker [Christina Gorton](https://twitter.com/coffeecraftcode) during Hacktoberst 2020. From there it grew and became more than pairing with folks on Forem issues. We also interviewed folks from the tech space. I went solo when Christina left Forem at the start of 2022 and continued the stream until the end of March 2022.

Good times and great guests. Thanks to everyone that was a part of it.
